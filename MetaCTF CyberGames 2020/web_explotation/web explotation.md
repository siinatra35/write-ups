Its a simple login page but after taking a look into the sources tab
we notice some files we left in and unedited. And in a file called framework.js
there is a if statement that contains the flag

```
if(password!="MetaCTF{So_You_Wanna_Play_With_Magic}"){
        alert("You did not enter the correct password!");
        notFailed = false;
    }
```
