<h3>Recon</h3>
We start by scanning with the nmap command.
We see that port 22 and 80 is open.

<b>Port 22</b>
<p>
We try ssh but we need the proper credentials in order to gain access. We can try some bruteforcing but I dont think thats the right method to get access with this machine.

<b>Port 80</b>
<p>Since port 80 is open its safe to assume that we can find a website. However we can't really get much info form this site....seems to be some medical site but not much to look at.</p>
