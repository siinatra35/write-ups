 <b><h2>IP: 10.10.10.14</h2></b>


<h2></h2>

Using <code>nmap -Pn -p- 10.10.10.14</code> we can see that port 80 is open. This leads us to a site that seems to be a IIS site.

However this site seems to be not yet completed. 

If we enter http://10.10.10.14 in dirbuster we get a large amount of directories but we do not have permissions to view the page.

From our nmap scan we can see the IIS version number using this information we can find a possible exploit. 

<h2>IIS exploit</h2

After some googling I found a repo on github that uses a payload generated by msfvenom and exploits the Microsoft IIS WebDav 'ScStoragePathFromUrl' Remote Buffer Overflow vulnerability.

By using this tool we can get a shell to the IIS server.

However we get a access denied when we try to enter the user folder and admin folder.

<h2>Privlage Escalation</h2>

To get some idea of what possible routes I could take I used the systeminfo command from within the IIS server and this was the result.
